#Functionality & Rationale
Functions for Hupfarri Website were purposefully considered to ensure that 
it is the most optimal for User Experience. Listed below is a non-exhaustive
explanation of the various components and why it was considered. 

##Navbar
The Navbar was designed with Mobile First in mind. When used from a mobile 
phone perspective, the search button is aligned to the right to ensure easy 
access to search for items required. 

In Bootstrap, I observed the search button to be right of the search bar. 
A design consideration that I decided to do away for better user experience. 

##Slider & Jumbotron 
Slider will mainly be appropriate for desktop viewing. Being able to show 
multiple discounts and promotions will allow customers to consider purchasing
online. 

Jumbotron is considered for screensizes md and below. This is because customers
are likely already in store or are considering making a trip down to our 
showroom. Hence, a helpful function linking to a contact page would aid
the customer.
