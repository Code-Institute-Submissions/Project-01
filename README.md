## Context
Hupfarri Singapore is a heritage brand founded in 2004. From humble beginnings as a small hardware shop, Hupfarri grew it’s operations and is one of the top home and sanitary fittings retailer in Singapore. Selling over 1,000 products across multiple categories, Hupfarri’s aim is to build a trustworthy brand with Singaporeans to become the top choice for home renovation. Hupfarri trademarked “OttO” brand in 2006, signalling a new era with made-in-Singapore bathroom fittings.

## Project Introduction
This project brief was to create a website for Singapore retailer, Hupfarri. Due to COVID19, they are interested in developing a e-commerce page that is mobile responsive so that they may continue to stay competitive in a digital world. 

## Design Principle
The conceptualisation behind Hupfarri website comes from multiple sources. At the beginning, I wanted to model the website after popular South-East Asian E-Commerce platform Lazada. However, upon review, the design did not gel well with the informational element required for a business to share it’s history. Hence, the current design was tweaked to incorporate a more corporate feel with full-width images to provide stronger visual branding for the company.

## Color Palette
Hupfarri’s RGB color (12,48,126) were used with a  opacity of 90% given to create a “faded” effect to the brand’s colour. The rationale for a consistent colour throughout the website is to improve brand recognisability and gel with in-store design and brand guide. 

## Use of Image
There is no denying the importance go good image in a website. Selection of image is done deliberately with images used for full-width to convey a sense of “emptiness” and “space”.

## Navbar 
Base on Hupfarri’s brief, the company would like to allow customers to log-in and sign-up before being able to purchase. This is evident from a log-in tab on the right of the Navbar. If given more time, development of log-in page, add-to-cart page and check-out page will be included to fit the objectives of the e-commerce element of the website. 

## Mobile Responsiveness
The website is mobile responsive with usage of minor animations to draw in the user’s attention when interacting with the page. Credits to scroll-effect library AOS-data for providing user friendly interactivity so that users may enjoy interacting with the site. 

## E-Commerce Element
Due to time constraint and the lack of knowledge of scripts, I am unable to create multiple product categories across multiple pages. With more time, I would like to develop the product categories in depth and ensure that there are multiple categories of functioning pages. The current links for individual categories will lead to products.html page instead. 

## Points to improve further
Due to the change in layout design direction midway, I felt I lacked sensitivity towards some pages and the use of semantic HTML. With more time, I would like to place heavier emphasis on the SEO-ability of the page as that will also be crucial for a business. Another thing lacking is a blog page which will also enhance the SEO component of the page. As the constraints of the business is the lack of a copywriter, I would love to add this page when it is feasible to do so.
